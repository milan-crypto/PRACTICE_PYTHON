# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them. Take this
# opportunity to think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in
# the sequence to generate. (Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the
# sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
# 13, â€¦)


# i = int(input("Please select a number: "))
# n = 0
# while i <= 1000000:
#     i = i + n
#     n = i - n
#     print(i)

nterms = int(input("How many terms? "))

# first two terms
n1, n2 = 0, 1
count = 0

# check if the number of terms is valid
if nterms <= 0:
   print("Please enter a positive integer")
# if there is only one term, return n1
elif nterms == 1:
   print("Fibonacci sequence upto",nterms,":")
   print(n1)
# generate fibonacci sequence
else:
   print("Fibonacci sequence:")
   while count < nterms:
       print(n1)
       nth = n1 + n2
       # update values
       n1 = n2
       n2 = nth
       count += 1
